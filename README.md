# METF-mapping â€” Karen State, Myanmar 

I focus here on the mapping component of METF because that was my primary contribution. While there were many other components to the METF program which I will link to separately, my role was as lead for the geospatial elements â€” so that is the emphasis in this repository.

The mapping program is also closely connected to other major research strands, including:
- The impacts of early diagnosis and treatment for *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria on malaria incidence
- The use of combination therapies for *P. falciparum*
- The use of targeted mass drug administration (tMDA) for *P. falciparum* elimination

Other repositories will document these other strands â€” particularly early diagnosis & treatment and tMDA â€” which both fed into and were influenced by METFâ€™s operational model. Linking these will give a fuller picture of the programâ€™s evolution and the shared lessons across initiatives.

Some of the broader history is detailed through interviews with FranÃ§ois Nosten, for example:
- [How malaria defeats our drugs](https://wellcome.org/news/how-malaria-defeats-our-drugs)
- [Scientists race to eliminate malaria as â€˜wonder drugâ€™ loses its powers](https://www.cnn.com/2014/03/25/health/scientists-eliminate-malaria)

## Methods & Operations

**Mapping & GIS:**  
From 2013â€“2016, METF conducted three waves of mapping across Karen/Kayin State using GPS+GLONASS devices for high-accuracy coordinates. Field teams were composed of locally trained community members, with community engagement (CE) experts engaging politically sensitive or conflict areas beforehand.  
- **Wave 1 (2013â€“14):** Mapped malaria service presence, staffing, supply status, village names, and household counts.  
- **Wave 2 (2014):** Filled geographic gaps, corrected locations, and identified referral clinics.  
- **Wave 3 (2015â€“16):** Added basic economic and infrastructure indicators.  

Data from mapping forms were merged with GPS outputs to create a central GIS (ArcGIS 10.2, QGIS 2.4, R, Python). Each village was assigned an anonymous ID used across project data systems.

**Community Engagement (CE):**  
A dedicated CE team supported every stageâ€”producing multilingual posters, audio announcements, and holding meetings with local leaders. CE activities preceded mapping, malaria post establishment, prevalence surveys, and mass drug administrations (MDAs). Engagement included village-wide meetings, group discussions tailored to sub-groups (women, school children, farmers, soldiers), and availability of mobile clinics and LLINs. Sensitive issuesâ€”like blood draw concerns or political mistrustâ€”were addressed through dialogue with community leaders, clarifying the programâ€™s independence from central government.

**Malaria Posts (MPs):**  
Following reconnaissance, the estimated need grew from ~800 to ~1,200 villages. Each MP was staffed by a trained, salaried local MP worker (MPW) and equipped with RDTs, antimalarials, basic medicines, pregnancy tests, scales, banners, and stationery. MPWs were selected by their communities and completed 5-day training in malaria case management, referrals, reporting, and CE, supported by bilingual manuals and treatment algorithms. These malaria posts were established on the foundation of evidence for early diagnosis and treatment (EDT) approaches â€” see [early-dx-tx](https://github.com/DMParker1/early-dx-tx) for background.
