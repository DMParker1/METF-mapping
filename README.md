## Methods & Operations

**Mapping & GIS:**  
From 2013–2016, METF conducted three waves of mapping across Karen/Kayin State using GPS+GLONASS devices for high-accuracy coordinates. Field teams were composed of locally trained community members, with community engagement (CE) experts engaging politically sensitive or conflict areas beforehand.  
- **Wave 1 (2013–14):** Mapped malaria service presence, staffing, supply status, village names, and household counts.  
- **Wave 2 (2014):** Filled geographic gaps, corrected locations, and identified referral clinics.  
- **Wave 3 (2015–16):** Added basic economic and infrastructure indicators.  

Data from mapping forms were merged with GPS outputs to create a central GIS (ArcGIS 10.2, QGIS 2.4, R, Python). Each village was assigned an anonymous ID used across project data systems.

**Community Engagement (CE):**  
A dedicated CE team supported every stage—producing multilingual posters, audio announcements, and holding meetings with local leaders. CE activities preceded mapping, malaria post establishment, prevalence surveys, and mass drug administrations (MDAs). Engagement included village-wide meetings, group discussions tailored to sub-groups (women, school children, farmers, soldiers), and availability of mobile clinics and LLINs. Sensitive issues—like blood draw concerns or political mistrust—were addressed through dialogue with community leaders, clarifying the program’s independence from central government.

**Malaria Posts (MPs):**  
Following reconnaissance, the estimated need grew from ~800 to ~1,200 villages. Each MP was staffed by a trained, salaried local MP worker (MPW) and equipped with RDTs, antimalarials, basic medicines, pregnancy tests, scales, banners, and stationery. MPWs were selected by their communities and completed 5-day training in malaria case management, referrals, reporting, and CE, supported by bilingual manuals and treatment algorithms.
